                <h2>What is Strassen's Matrix Multiplication?</h2>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h3>Divide-and-Conquer Strategy:</h3>
            <p>Divide and conquer is a problem-solving method where you break a big problem into smaller ones, solve them, and then combine the solutions. It's efficient because it simplifies complex tasks by breaking them down into manageable chunks. In the context of matrix multiplication:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Divide:</strong> Break down the input matrices into smaller submatrices.</li>
  <li><strong>Conquer:</strong> Multiply these submatrices recursively until reaching a base case.</li>
  <li><strong>Combine:</strong> Combine the results of the smaller multiplications to obtain the final result.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Strassen's Algorithm Steps:</h3>
<p>
  Strassen's algorithm is a specialized application of the divide and conquer approach, specifically tailored for optimizing matrix multiplication tasks.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Divide Step:</strong><br><br>
    Given two matrices A and B, divide each matrix into four equal-sized submatrices:<br>
    A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]]<br>
    B = [[B11, B12], [B21, B22]]</li><br>
  <li><strong>Conquer Step:</strong><br><br>
    Recursively compute seven matrix products:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>M1 = (A11 + A22)(B11 + B22)</li>
    <li>M2 = (A21 + A22)B11</li>
    <li>M3 = A11(B12 - B22)</li>
    <li>M4 = A22(B21 - B11)</li>
    <li>M5 = (A11 + A12)B22</li>
    <li>M6 = (A21 - A11)(B11 + B12)</li>
    <li>M7 = (A12 - A22)(B21 + B22)</li>
    </ul>
  </li><br>
  <li><strong>Combine Step:</strong><br><br>
    Compute the resulting submatrices of the product matrix C using the following equations:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>C11 = M1 + M4 - M5 + M7</li>
      <li>C12 = M3 + M5</li>
      <li>C21 = M2 + M4</li>
      <li>C22 = M1 + M3 - M2 + M6</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

            <p>
                Thus,
            </p>
            <img src="materials/Img1.png" alt="" height="100px" width="400px">
            <p>The Strassen algorithm reduces the number of basic multiplications needed for multiplying two n/2 x n/2 matrices to 7, compared to the standard algorithm, while also requiring 18 matrix additions or subtractions. Since n is a power of 2, it can be represented as 2^k, where k is a non-negative integer. If k equals 0, indicating that n is 1, the time complexity of matrix multiplication is constant, denoted by 1. For k greater than 0, the time complexity of matrix multiplication can be expressed recursively using Master Theorem, as shown.</p>
            <img src="materials/Img2.png" alt="" height="60px" width="400px"><br>
            <p><b>7T(n/2)</b>: represents the time complexity of recursively multiplying the submatrices. Since Strassen's algorithm splits each matrix into seven submatrices, there are seven recursive calls to multiply these submatrices.
            <br><br><b>18(n/2)^2</b>: represents the time complexity of the additional operations involved in combining the results of the subproblems. This includes additions and subtractions of matrices, which are constant time operations but involve (n/2)^2 elements.
            <br><br>Now consider n=2^k (as n is in powers of 2), the equation becomes:
            </p>
            <img src="materials/Img3.png" alt="" height="60px" width="400px"><br>
            <p>Since,</p>
            <img src="materials/Img4.png" alt="" height="60px" width="400px"><br>
            <p>and,</p>

            <a href="https://www.atlantis-press.com/article/8739.pdf"><h5><center>Reference: Analysis of Strassen's Time Complexity</center></h5></a>
            <p>The time complexity of Strassen's algorithm can be expressed as O(n^2.81), demonstrating its efficiency compared to the general matrix multiplication algorithm. To accommodate matrices with dimensions that are not powers of 2, they can be embedded into larger matrices (e.g., matrix E) with dimensions that are powers of 2. Despite potential dimension adjustments, the time complexity of Strassen's algorithm remains O(n^2.81).</p>
