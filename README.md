# Strassen-Visualizer
Helps users visualize the Strassen Matrix Multiplication Algorithm

The platform developed offers the following provisions to users:

1. Virtual Simulator: An animation prototype aimed at facilitating step-by-step depiction of the algorithm, enhancing comprehension through interactive visual representation and improving understanding of Strassen matrix multiplication. 
It accepts user input, where the user specifies the order of the matrix and provides the entries. 
It currently supports maximum dimension of 4x4 for input matrices.
This algorithm stands efficient for square matrices of order in powers of 2.

2. Reading material on Strassen’s Algorithm: Provides theoretical information pertaining to Divide and Conquer Approach, Strassen Matrix Multiplication, and derivation of its Time Complexity through Master Theorem. It also provides  useful links to the user for further reading and understanding of the concept.

3. Virtual Simulator of Time Complexity Graphs: Provides a clear visualisation of the time complexity of Strassen’s Algorithm, versus the naive approach.

4. Feedback section for users regarding website experience.
